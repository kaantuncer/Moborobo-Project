# CALIBRATION

* For calibration, a rosbag file must be recorded firstly. 

* Then copy this rosbag file to <b> `/home/moborobot/catkin_ws/src/lidar_camera_calibration/bagfiles` </b> folder.

* Change default bagfile argument in <b> `play_rosbag.launch` </b> file.

* After the starting roscore, play this rosbag file with;

```
roslaunch lidar_camera_calibration play_rosbag.launch
```

* While rosbag file is playing, start the calibration code with;
```
rosrun lidar_camera_calibration calibrate_camera_lidar.py
```
* This python script must have the permission. Give permission with;
```
sudo chmod 777 /home/moborobot/catkin_ws/src/lidar_camera_calibration/scripts/calibrate_camera_lidar_py
```
